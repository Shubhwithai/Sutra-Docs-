title: SUTRA with CrewAI - Jupyter Notebook Documentation
---

This MDX file documents the **Sutra with CrewAI** Jupyter notebook, sourced from the [Sutra Cookbook repository](https://github.com/sutra-dev/sutra-cookbook/blob/main/notebooks/sutra_with_crewai.ipynb). The notebook demonstrates how to use the SUTRA LLM model, developed by Two Platforms, with the CrewAI framework to create collaborative AI agent teams. It showcases two use cases: a cultural research crew for analyzing Indian culture and a multilingual content creation crew for generating content in Hindi and Tamil.

## Overview

The SUTRA LLM is a family of large multilingual language models (LMLMs) supporting over 50 languages, powered by a dual-transformer approach combining Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Dense AI architectures. CrewAI is a framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents that collaborate to perform complex tasks. This notebook integrates SUTRA’s multilingual capabilities with CrewAI to build agent teams for cultural research and content creation, leveraging SUTRA’s proficiency in Indian languages and cultural contexts.

The notebook includes:
- Basic usage of SUTRA with the OpenAI client.
- Integration of SUTRA with CrewAI via a custom LLM class.
- A cultural research crew analyzing topics like the Diwali festival.
- A multilingual content creation crew generating content about sustainable living in Hindi and Tamil.

## Prerequisites

To run this Jupyter notebook, ensure you have the following:
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher, preferably 3.10.12 as specified in the notebook)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab** (the notebook is designed for Colab)
- **Required packages**:
  - `openai` (`pip install openai`)
  - `crewai` (`pip install crewai 'crewai[tools]'`)
  - `google-colab` (for Colab-specific secrets management, pre-installed in Colab)
- A valid **Sutra API key** (obtain from [Two AI's SUTRA API page](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api))
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for accessing Colab

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Run in Google Colab
1. Open the notebook in Colab using the provided link: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qwel8pph9pL_m1dmy3CmMG7xIsYxYA6c?usp=sharing).
2. Set up your SUTRA API key in Colab Secrets:
   - Go to the “Secrets” tab in Colab (lock icon in the sidebar).
   - Add a secret named `SUTRA_API_KEY` with your API key as the value.
3. Run the cells in sequence to install dependencies, set up the environment, and execute the code.
4. No local installation is required, as Colab provides the Python environment.

### Option 2: Run Locally
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install openai crewai 'crewai[tools]' jupyter
   ```
2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project directory with:
   ```bash
   SUTRA_API_KEY=your_sutra_api_key_here
   ```
   Alternatively, set the environment variable manually:
   ```bash
   export SUTRA_API_KEY=your_sutra_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Save the Notebook**:
   Save the provided code as `sutra_with_crewai.ipynb`.
4. **Run the Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `sutra_with_crewai.ipynb` in the browser and run the cells in sequence.

## Notebook Code

The following sections present the Python code from the notebook, organized by its key components.

### 1. Setup and Installation
Install the required packages.

```python
!pip install openai crewai 'crewai[tools]'
```

### 2. Setting Up Environment Variables
Configure the SUTRA API key, using Colab Secrets for security in Google Colab.

```python
import os
from google.colab import userdata

# Set the API key from Colab secrets
os.environ["SUTRA_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("SUTRA_API_KEY")
```

For local environments, load the API key from a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
os.environ["SUTRA_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("SUTRA_API_KEY")
```

### 3. Basic Usage of SUTRA with OpenAI Client
Demonstrate a simple interaction with the SUTRA LLM using the OpenAI client.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client with Sutra's API endpoint
client = OpenAI(
    base_url='https://api.two.ai/v2',
    api_key=os.environ["SUTRA_API_KEY"]
)

# Simple completion with Sutra
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sutra-v2",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that specializes in Indian languages and culture."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about the importance of the Ganga river in Indian culture."}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 4. Integrating SUTRA with CrewAI
Create a custom LLM class for CrewAI to use the SUTRA model.

```python
from crewai import LLM

llm = LLM(
    model="openai/sutra-v2",
    api_key=os.getenv("SUTRA_API_KEY"),
    api_base="https://api.two.ai/v2",
)
```

### 5. Creating a Cultural Research Crew

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Cultural Research Crew (Diwali Festival)
1. Run the cultural research crew section with `topic="Diwali festival"`.
2. Expected outputs:
   - **Research Task**: A report detailing Diwali’s history, regional variations (e.g., North vs. South India), and modern celebrations.
   - **Linguistic Analysis Task**: Explanations of terms like “Deepavali” (Tamil), “Diwali” (Hindi), their etymology, and translations.
   - **Content Creation Task**: An article like:
     ```
     ## The Vibrant Festival of Diwali
     Diwali, the festival of lights, is one of India’s most cherished celebrations. Originating from ancient traditions, it symbolizes the victory of light over darkness. In North India, Diwali is marked by lighting diyas and fireworks, while in Tamil Nadu, Deepavali includes early morning oil baths. The word “Diwali” derives from Sanskrit “Deepavali,” meaning “row of lights.” Today, Diwali unites diverse communities in celebration, reflection, and sharing.
     ```

### Example 2: Multilingual Content Creation Crew (Sustainable Living)
1. Run the multilingual content crew section with `topic="sustainable living practices"`.
2. Expected outputs:
   - **Strategy Task**: A strategy document outlining messaging for Hindi and Tamil audiences, e.g., emphasizing local practices like rainwater harvesting in Tamil Nadu.
   - **Hindi Content Task**: Content like:
     ```
     ## सतत जीवन शैली: पर्यावरण के लिए कदम
     सतत जीवन शैली अपनाना पर्यावरण संरक्षण के लिए महत्वपूर्ण है। भारत में, वर्षा जल संचयन और जैविक खेती जैसी प्रथाएं लोकप्रिय हैं। ये न केवल पर्यावरण को बचाती हैं बल्कि समुदायों को आत्मनिर्भर बनाती हैं।
     ```
   - **Tamil Content Task**: Content like:
     ```
     ## நிலையான வாழ்க்கை முறைகள்
     நிலையான வாழ்க்கை முறைகள் சுற்றுச்சூழலைப் பாதுகாக்க உதவுகின்றன. தமிழ்நாட்டில், மழைநீர் சேகரிப்பு மற்றும் இயற்கை விவசாயம் பரவலாக உள்ளன. இவை சமூகங்களை சுயமாக ஆக்குகின்றன.
     ```
   - **Editing Task**: Edited versions ensuring consistency and a report confirming cultural appropriateness.

## Notes

- **API Key**: A valid Sutra API key is required from [Two AI's SUTRA API page](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api). Store it securely in Colab Secrets or a `.env` file.
- **Multilingual Support**: SUTRA’s strength in Indian languages (e.g., Hindi, Tamil) makes it ideal for these use cases. Ensure the API supports the target languages.
- **CrewAI Framework**: The sequential process ensures tasks build on each other, but complex workflows may require tuning agent roles or task dependencies.
- **Limitations**:
  - Requires a stable internet connection for API calls.
  - Output quality depends on SUTRA’s language proficiency and the specificity of task descriptions.
  - Colab’s free tier may have resource constraints for large-scale runs.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Add more agents (e.g., a data analyst for quantitative insights) or languages (e.g., Bengali, Telugu).
  - Integrate external tools (e.g., web scraping for real-time data) via CrewAI’s `tools` package.
  - Modify task prompts for different topics (e.g., Indian cuisine, yoga) or output formats (e.g., blog posts, social media content).
- **Local Setup**: If running locally, ensure `python-dotenv` is installed for environment variable management, as the notebook’s Colab-specific `userdata` module won’t work.
