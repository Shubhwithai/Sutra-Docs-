## 🚀 Step 1: Get Started
1. **Obtain an API Key**: Sign up at [https://www.two.ai/sutra/api](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api) to get a free SUTRA API key.
2. **Test on ChatSUTRA**: Try SUTRA’s capabilities via [chat.two.ai](https://chat.two.ai) on web or mobile (iOS/Android).
3. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
!pip install -qU openai
```

## 🔐 Step 2: Basic Usage with SUTRA-V2
```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize SUTRA client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_SUTRA_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.two.ai/v2"
)

# Basic chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sutra-v2",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI that answers concisely."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain AI in three sentences in Tamil."}
    ],
    max_tokens=1024,
    temperature=0.7
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
- **Invalid API Key**: Verify your key at [https://www.two.ai/sutra/api](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api).
- **Model Not Found**: Use `sutra-v2` for conversational tasks or `sutra-r0` for reasoning. SUTRA-V1 was deprecated on March 22, 2025.
- **Rate Limits**: Reduce request frequency or contact TWO AI at [https://www.two.ai/support](https://www.two.ai/support).
- **Language Issues**: Ensure prompts match the target language’s script and syntax.
