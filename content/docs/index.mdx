- Knowledge Extraction: Summarize and process content.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhance responses with external data.

## Key Capabilities
- Multilingual Support: Fluency in over 50 languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Japanese, and Spanish, with strong Multilingual MMLU scores (e.g., Hindi: 81.44, Gujarati: 79.39).
- High Throughput: Optimized for low-latency, real-time applications.
- Structured Output: Generate JSON or task-specific formats via prompts.
- Advanced Reasoning: Handle logic-driven tasks and multi-turn conversations with SUTRA-R0.

## Step 1: Get Started
1. Obtain an API Key: Sign up at [TWO AI SUTRA API](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api).
2. Test on ChatSUTRA: Explore capabilities at [chat.two.ai](https://chat.two.ai).
3. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

## Step 2: Basic Usage with SUTRA-V2
```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize SUTRA client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_SUTRA_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.two.ai/v2"
)

# Basic chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sutra-v2",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain AI in three sentences in Tamil."}
    ],
    max_tokens=1024,
    temperature=0.7
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Troubleshooting
- Invalid API Key: Verify at [TWO AI SUTRA API](https://www.two.ai/sutra/api).
- Model Not Found: Use `sutra-v2` for conversations or `sutra-r0` for reasoning. SUTRA-V1 was deprecated on March 22, 2025.
- Rate Limits: Reduce request frequency.
- Language Issues: Ensure prompts align with the target languageâ€™s script and syntax.
